## Key Challenges & What Was Learned

### 1. Dynamic Currency & Country Support
**Challenge**: Implementing dynamic currency symbols and country flags based on user selection.

**Solution**: Created a mapping system for country codes to currency symbols and flag assets.

**Learning**: 
- How to structure data mappings for internationalization
- Asset management for country-specific resources
- Currency formatting without external packages

### 2. State Management Across Screens
**Challenge**: Sharing transaction data between HomeScreen and NotificationsScreen.

**Solution**: Implemented callback functions and state lifting to pass data through the widget tree.

**Learning**:
- Flutter's widget lifecycle and state management
- Proper data flow patterns in Flutter
- When to use StatefulWidget vs StatelessWidget

### 3. Complex Navigation Flows
**Challenge**: Managing multiple transaction types with different input requirements (phone numbers vs account numbers).

**Solution**: Created separate screens for different transaction types while maintaining consistent UI patterns.

**Learning**:
- Navigation patterns in Flutter
- Screen organization and separation of concerns
- Maintaining UI consistency across different flows

### 4. Real-time Activity Synchronization
**Challenge**: Keeping activity list and notifications in sync across different transaction types.

**Solution**: Standardized transaction data structure and implemented proper state updates.

**Learning**:
- Data structure consistency across different features
- Real-time UI updates
- Cross-screen state synchronization

### 5. Transaction Type Integration
**Challenge**: Connecting different transaction flows (Airtime, Transfer, Mobile Money, Bill Payment) to the activity system.

**Solution**: Created consistent transaction data structure and proper integration points.

**Learning**:
- Modular transaction handling
- Consistent data formats
- Integration patterns for different features

### 6. UI/UX Consistency
**Challenge**: Ensuring all screens follow the same design language and layout patterns.

**Solution**: Established consistent color schemes, spacing, and component patterns.

**Learning**:
- Design system implementation in Flutter
- Color and typography consistency
- Responsive design principles

### 7. Code Organization & Maintainability
**Challenge**: Keeping the codebase clean and maintainable as features grew.

**Solution**: 
- Separated concerns into different files
- Removed unused code and dependencies
- Established clear naming conventions

**Learning**:
- Flutter project structure best practices
- Code cleanup and refactoring techniques
- Dependency management

### 8. Form Validation & User Input
**Challenge**: Handling different input types (phone numbers, account numbers, amounts) with proper validation.

**Solution**: Implemented input-specific validation and user-friendly error messages.

**Learning**:
- Form handling in Flutter
- Input validation patterns
- User experience considerations

### 9. Asset Management
**Challenge**: Managing country flags and ensuring proper asset loading.

**Solution**: Organized assets in a structured way and implemented proper error handling for missing assets.

**Learning**:
- Flutter asset management
- Error handling for missing resources
- Asset optimization techniques

## Technical Decisions

### Why Flutter?
- Cross-platform development capability
- Rich widget library
- Hot reload for rapid development
- Strong community support

### Architecture Choices
- **Simple State Management**: Used setState for local state and callbacks for cross-screen communication
- **Named Routes**: For navigation consistency
- **Stateless vs Stateful**: Carefully chosen based on state requirements
- **Built-in Widgets Only**: Avoided external dependencies for core functionality

### Performance Considerations
- Efficient list rendering with ListView.builder
- Proper widget disposal
- Minimal rebuilds through strategic state management

## Transaction System

### Supported Transaction Types
1. **Airtime & Data Purchase**
   - Network selection (MTN, Vodafone, AirtelTigo)
   - Amount validation
   - Real-time balance updates

2. **Bank Transfers**
   - Domestic transfers
   - International transfers
   - Account number validation

3. **Mobile Money**
